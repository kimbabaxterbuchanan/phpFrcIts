User Guide:
<p>
FRC Report Maker is based on the SELECT syntax of MySql
document. Although the select syntax has various options, only
commonly used options have been incorporated in this release. If
you are not familiar with the general SELECT syntax, please take
a few moments to review it in your favorite document. This will help you
to follow this program easily. 
</p>
<p>
The Welcome screen gives you an option to either create a new 
query or load an existing query for its execution. All the queries
must be in the sqldocs directory. Clicking on Select... button will
advance you to next screen.  
</p>
Details:
<p>
1. Choosing the Create option, brings forward the database selection
box. Presently only one database can be selected.<br>If you chose Run
option, please go to step 6.
</p>
<p>
2. After selecting the database, you have an option to select multiple
tables. This is important in case you want to make queries for related
tables. The standard way to select multiple items is to hold the Ctrl
key on your keyboard and click on the items you are choosing. This program
aliases the tables as t0, t1, etc. 
</p>
<p>
3. In this step you will be prompted to select fileds from the tables. The
last items in the tables such as t0.* would be enough to pick up all the
fields in the table. If you are selecting individual fields, do not choose
t0.* type field. This screen also gives you an option to choose aggregate
functions such as count, max, min, avg, std and sum. In the Expr column, you
can enter the field name or a * as required by Select statement. A t0.* does
not work whereas a * will work.
</p>
<p>
4. The next screen is the general Select option screen. At the top you will
see uptodate select statement. Do not try to correct any obvious error you
may see at this point(like a , in a wrong place) as it is a static field. The
various clause fields will be expalined in the order they are presented.
</p>
<p>
	a. WHERE Clause has four fields namely field, operator, value and
condition. The Field merely lists the fields selected in a dropdown select
box. You can select up to five fields for your query. The operator is again
a select box where you choose your appropriate opertaion. In the value field
you will enter the parameters on which the where clause is being built. One
simple example will be field=t0.id, operator=>,value=101 etc. The string must
be quoted such as "John". In the LIKE operator case, you must use "j%" or its
varitaion. The Condition blcok can be AND, OR or default blank. Make sure that
the last condtion is always blank.
</p>
<p>
	b. GROUP BY Clause has only Field select box. Default is none. You
may choose one of the group by fields if you are choosing aggregate functions.
</p>
<p>
	c. Having Clause has only one Expr Field. Enter your condition manually
for a proper select operation(See MySql manual or your book of choice).
Thanks for choosing MySql Query Maker 1.0 program!
</p>
<p>
	d. ORDER BY Clause has Field, Expr field and Sort boxes. You can
select a field form the dropdown select box. The optional Expr Field is
required in some special cases. The Sort select can be ASC for ascending and
DESC for descending sort.
</p>
<p>
	e. The LIMIT Clause makes you choose how many rows you want to be
displayed. The Offset is the starting row number(which can be omitted if you
want to start at row 1) and number of rows is the number of desired rows to be
displayed.
</p>
<p>
5. The next screen shows the final assembled query with the available otions.
You can edit the query in the textarea. If the execution of this query gives
you an error, you can come back here and conveniently edit your query and run
it again without going over the entire process. You have an option to save
this query or to load a completely different query at this point. All the
queries are saved in the sqldocs directory.
</p>
<p>
6. If you chose PickQuery or Run option, you will be prompted to pick a
file from the sqldocs directory and prescribe the name of the database
associated with the query. Executing the LoadQuery button, you will be in
the query execution area. The details of this screen are outlined in step 5.
